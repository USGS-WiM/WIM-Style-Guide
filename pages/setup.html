        Download the zip file and extract it. Add the <b>wim.css file</b> to your project directory. Make sure wim.css is the <b>last</b> CSS file referenced in your HTML, especially make sure it's referenced after bootstrap. This stylesheet is compressed and includes all fonts, icons, colors, button styles, etc.  This file is compressed and not readable. If you want to make changes, create your own custom CSS file and reference it <b>after wim.css</b>, or download the separate, uncompressed stylesheet partials below.\
    </p>
    <blockquote>You can still use Bootstrap's grids and other elements, available for download at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="blank">getbootstrap.com</a></blockquote>
    <blockquote>JQuery is also recommended for certain functions. Available at <a href="https://code.jquery.com/" target="blank">code.jquery.com</a></blockquote>
    <p>
        After adding wim.css to your project, go back to the .zip file and open the <i>/branding/</i> directory. This contains all WiM Logos. Move <b>favicon.ico and favicon.png</b> into your project and reference it as the Favicon using:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">&lt;![endif]--><br/>&lt;link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.png"&gt; &lt;!-- Everything else --&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Use the other WiM icons/logos as you need throughout your application.

        You can also download an uncompiled/uncompressed copy of all the stylesheets if you want to make edits yourself, or only include certain elements (like input elements). Download the .zip below and it will include LESS files for different types of elements (typography, inputs, etc). Edit them and include them in your project as you want.
