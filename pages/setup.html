    <h1>Setup - Full Styles</h1>
    <h3>Includes all Fonts, Logos, and Icons Packs (Font Awesome & Ionicons)</h3>
    <p>
         Add the <b>wim.css file</b> to your project directory. Make sure wim.css is the <b>last</b> CSS file referenced in your HTML, especially make sure it's referenced after bootstrap.
    </p>
    <blockquote>You can still use Bootstrap's grids and other elements, available for download at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="blank">getbootstrap.com</a></blockquote>
    <blockquote>JQuery is also recommended for certain functions. Available at <a href="https://code.jquery.com/" target="blank">code.jquery.com</a></blockquote>
    <p>
        After adding wim.css to your project, additional assets are available in the <i>/assets/branding/</i> directory. This contains all WiM Logos. Move <b>favicon.ico and favicon.png</b> into your project and reference it as the Favicon using:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">&lt;![endif]--><br/>&lt;link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.png"&gt; &lt;!-- Everything else --&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Use the other WiM icons/logos as you need throughout your application.
    </p>

        The linked github repository also contains uncompiled/uncompressed copies of all the stylesheets if you want to make edits yourself, or only include certain elements (like input elements).  Edit them and include them in your project as you want.
